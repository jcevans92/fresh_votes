Voting App
 
A schoolâ€™s cafeteria wishes to provide healthier snacking options for its students. The school would like to know which fruit their students prefer by providing a number options and having the students vote on their favorites. 

Build a small functional snack voting app with a modern UI.  You can use any set of technologies and any frameworks or libraries that you are comfortable with. The only technology requirement is that your project use a modern client-side framework or library like Angular, React, or Vue.js that interacts with a server-side REST API. Bonus point you can build this using PHP on the server side.

The application can be hosted anywhere as long as it is publicly accessible. 

Once the app is completed, please report back with the URL and send the codebase in a zip archive. You may post the code on GitHub and use it as a portfolio project. 

The app should meet the following requirements:
 
The students should be presented with a list of items to vote on.  This list of items and students does not need to be dynamic - it can be seeded into your datastore.
 
Have at least two student users inserted:
Jane
John

The user would see this list of items:
Apple
Orange
Banana
Pineapple

The students should be able to interact with the UI to vote for a particular item which will increase the number of votes for that item.

The list of items should be sorted by the number of votes. The item with the highest number of votes will appear at the top of the list.

Users should be able to leave the site and come back and see their votes again - meaning the votes must persist and be stored in a server-side/cloud datastore.

The UI should be attractive and polished.
